I"ƒ<p>The synthesis of light elements in the early universe is a complex process, and provides much insight into the thermodynamic state of each particle species that is present. The agreement between precise measurements of the light element abundances such as Hydrogen, Helium and Lithium provides strong evidence for a Hot Big Bang. Nonetheless, it is known that new physics is required both in the Standard models of particle physics and cosmology. The precision of these light element abundances can place tight constraints on the type of new physics that can be at play.</p>
