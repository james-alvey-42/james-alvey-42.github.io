I"0<p>Direct detection experiments relying on nuclear recoil signatures lose sensitivity to sub-GeV dark matter for typical galactic velocities. This sensitivity is recovered if there exists another source of flux with higher momenta. Such an energetic flux of light dark matter could originate from the decay of mesons produced in inelastic cosmic ray collisions. We compute this novel production mechanism - a cosmic beam dump experiment - and estimate the resulting limits from XENON1T and LZ. We find that the dark matter flux from inelastic cosmic rays colliding with atmospheric nuclei can dominate over the flux from elastic collisions with relic dark matter.</p>

<p><em>Summary:</em> There is a common issue with all direct detection experiments in that they lose sensitivity to light dark matter due to small nuclear recoils. We estimated the impact that inelastic collisions of cosmic rays in the atmosphere, producing light dark matter from meson decays, could have on the direct detection parameter space.</p>

<h2 id="direct-detection">Direct Detection</h2>

<p>There are a couple of ways we might think about trying to deduce the existence of (particle) dark matter. This is well illustrated by the following diagram;</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/detection.png" alt="detection" /></p>

<p>We can view this in a couple of ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Top to Bottom</strong> - Indirect Detection e.g. X-ray background, annihilation of DM into standard model particles</li>
  <li><strong>Bottom to Top</strong> - Production e.g. proton-proton collisions at the LHC leading to msising energy etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Left to Right</strong> - Direct Detection e.g. nuclear recoils</li>
</ol>

<p>It is of course the latter case we are interested in here.</p>
