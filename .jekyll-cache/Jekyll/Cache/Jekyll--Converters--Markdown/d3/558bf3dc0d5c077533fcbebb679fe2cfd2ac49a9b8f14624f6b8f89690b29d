I"É<p>We can learn a lot of interesting physics from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) using classical statistical techniques and state-of-the-art data from the Planck collaboration. The question we look to answer here is what data format is the most robust to non-standard methods such as Machine Learning techniques.</p>

<h3 id="research-question">Research Question</h3>

<p>We will look to answer the following basic question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is the best format to reconstruct the CMB temperature power spectrum from a given CMB map?</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="methodology">Methodology</h3>

<p>To do so, weâ€™ll consider three basic structures and architectures:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>[A1]</strong> A very basic feedforward network with a one-dimensional input - we expect this to perform poorly and take a long time to train. Furthermore, we would expect it to not be robust at all to slight modifications (e.g. reorderings/deletions) in the original map.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>[A2]</strong> A more complicated convolutional neural network acting on the true pixel map - we expect this to perform better as it has spatial information naturally encoded into the data format.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>[A3]</strong> Finally, we will look at encoding the CMB as a graph (in the mathematical sense) with the power spectrum encoded in the edges. We expect this will be the most robust to any deletions and reorderings.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
