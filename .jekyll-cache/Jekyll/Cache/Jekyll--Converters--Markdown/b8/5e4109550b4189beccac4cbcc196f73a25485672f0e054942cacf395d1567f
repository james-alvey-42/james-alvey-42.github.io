I"ÿ	<p>Monte Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC) have many applications across physics and statistics in the estimation of parameters and uncertainties given data in a Bayesian framework. The underlying use of the Markov Chain, however, is to solve the more fundamental issue of <em>sampling</em>.</p>

<h2 id="the-sampling-problem">The Sampling Problem</h2>

<p>We can state the sampling problem as follows;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{D}</script> be a distribution over a finite set <script type="math/tex">X</script>. Further, we assume that we have access to <script type="math/tex">p(x)</script> for some <script type="math/tex">x</script>in X<script type="math/tex">which outputs the probabiliity of drawing</script>x<script type="math/tex">given</script>\mathcal{D}<script type="math/tex">. The sampling problem is to design an algorithm</script>\mathcal{A}<script type="math/tex">which outputs an element of</script>x<script type="math/tex">approximately with probability</script>p(x)$$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reason this is a problem is the following: suppose you generate a large number of choices <script type="math/tex">\{x_0, x_1, x_2, \cdots\}</script> from the underlying set according to some distribtuion that is <em>not</em> <script type="math/tex">p(x)</script>. As it stands, this is certainly not a sample that is close to being representative of the underlying distribution. To generate a genuine sample from this selection, we have to apply some criterion to each point. Note that we have access to <script type="math/tex">\{p(x_0), p(x_1), \cdots\}</script>, so this criterion might take the form of the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Simulate the list <script type="math/tex">\{x_0, x_1, \cdots\}</script></li>
  <li>For each data point <script type="math/tex">x_k</script>, compute <script type="math/tex">p(x_k)</script></li>
  <li>Generate a random number <script type="math/tex">p \sim U[0, 1]</script></li>
  <li>If <script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
p < p(x_k) %]]></script>, add the point <script type="math/tex">x_k</script> to the sample, else reject the point</li>
</ol>

<p>The probelm with this is that for a large set <script type="math/tex">X</script>, there might only be a small region where the probability is non-neglible, so the vast majority of the points in the original list will be rejected. The above approach will generate a sample that reflects the underlying distribution, the problem is that it will be very slow. To show that this really does work, consider the following example.</p>
