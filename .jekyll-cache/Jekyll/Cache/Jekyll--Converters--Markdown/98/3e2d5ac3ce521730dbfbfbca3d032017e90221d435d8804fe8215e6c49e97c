I"¥<p>Direct detection experiments relying on nuclear recoil signatures lose sensitivity to sub-GeV dark matter for typical galactic velocities. This sensitivity is recovered if there exists another source of flux with higher momenta. Such an energetic flux of light dark matter could originate from the decay of mesons produced in inelastic cosmic ray collisions. We compute this novel production mechanism - a cosmic beam dump experiment - and estimate the resulting limits from XENON1T and LZ. We find that the dark matter flux from inelastic cosmic rays colliding with atmospheric nuclei can dominate over the flux from elastic collisions with relic dark matter.</p>

<p><em>Summary:</em> We place a <strong>lower bound</strong> on the thermal dark matter mass of 3.7 MeV, independent of spin or coupling to neutrinos or photons. We expect this to improve by an order of magnitude with future CMB experiments such as the Simons Observatory and CMB-S4.</p>
