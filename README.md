# About Me

I am a PhD student in Theoretical Particle Physics and Comsology at King's College London. Broadly I am interested in how to model the early Universe and use data from Cosmology to constrain new physics. I'm also interested in how to use simple data techniques to answer people based research questions.

## Physics Profile

A summary of my recent publications can be found on [Inspire-HEP](http://inspirehep.net/search?p=exactauthor%3AJ.B.G.Alvey.1&sf=earliestdate).

### DarkBBN

The synthesis of light elements in the early universe is a complex process, and provides much insight into the thermodynamic state of each particle species that is present. The agreement between precise measurements of the light element abundances such as Hydrogen, Helium and Lithium provides strong evidence for a Hot Big Bang. Nonetheless, it is known that new physics is required both in the Standard models of particle physics and cosmology. The precision of these light element abundances can place tight constraints on the type of new physics that can be at play.

The relevant repository can be found [here](https://github.com/james-alvey-42/DarkBBN), and a summary of the work can be found at this [link](https://james-alvey-42.github.io/bbn/). The repository is related to two papers written with colleagues at King's College London.

* [Refined Bounds on MeV-scale Thermal Dark Sectors from BBN and the CMB](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.01649.pdf)
* [Improved BBN Constraints on the Variation of the Gravitational Constant](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10730.pdf)

### Boosted Dark Matter

There is a common issue with all direct detection experiments in that they lose sensitivity to light dark matter due to small nuclear recoils. We estimated the impact that inelastic collisions of cosmic rays in the atmosphere, producing light dark matter from meson decays, could have on the direct detection parameter space.

Again, the relevant repository for the work is found [here](https://github.com/james-alvey-42/BoostedDM), with a summary of the topic at this [link](https://james-alvey-42.github.io/boosteddm/). It is related to a paper written with colleagues at King's College London and the University of Cambridge.

* [Light Dark Matter from Inelastic Cosmic Ray Collisions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.05776.pdf)

### Neutrinos at IceCube

Some motivated models of dark matter involve couplings to neutrinos which are often introduced to generate the experimentally observed non-zero neutrino mass. These couplings can affect the propagation of neutrinos across cosmological distances. We look to use data from the IceCube experiment to constrain such models and give an outlook for future observations.

The relevant repository is [this one](https://github.com/james-alvey-42/IceCubeNeutrinos) with a summary given [here](https://james-alvey-42.github.io/neutrinos/). It is related to work in an article written with a colleague at King's College London.

* [Linking Scalar Dark Matter and Neutrino Masses with IceCube 170922A](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.01450.pdf)

### Talks

There is also a repository with the various [talks](https://github.com/james-alvey-42/Talks) I have given on these topics plus some others of general interest. Quick links to these can be found below.

* [Big Bang Nucleosynthesis - DMUK (PDF)](https://james-alvey-42.github.io/assets/pdf/DMUK.pdf)
* [The Atmosphere as a Beam Dump - BUSSTEPP (PDF)](https://james-alvey-42.github.io/assets/pdf/beam-dump.pdf)

## Beyond Physics

In addition to this, there is some content related to programming tips and techniques, code examples, and other projects. A non-exhaustive list is given below.

* **Free Speed in Python** - The notebook can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/james-alvey-42/ProgramTools/tree/master/PythonLessons) and the accompanying talk [here](https://james-alvey-42.github.io/assets/pdf/free-speed.pdf). This is part of a series of lectures at King's College London (see [KCL Physics](https://github.com/KCLPhysics/CarpentryOctober2019) for more).
* **Monte Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC)** - A link to a post about this with some code examples can be found [here](https://james-alvey-42.github.io/mcmc/) with the source code in [this](https://github.com/james-alvey-42/ProgramTools/tree/master/MCMC) repository.
* **Unit Testing** - For a very basic example of how to write unit tests, see [here](https://github.com/james-alvey-42/ProgramTools/tree/master/Testing).
* **Sphinx Documentation** - This is a base template for how to use sphinx to document your project, the code is [here](https://github.com/james-alvey-42/ProgramTools/tree/master/Sphinx).
* **Flask** - Again, can be used as a template for how to build and deploy a Flask server application with very basic user setup. The code is [here](https://github.com/james-alvey-42/ProgramTools/tree/master/Flask).
* **Python Style Files** - A tutorial on how to write and save your own default style file in Matplotlib is given [here](https://james-alvey-42.github.io/stylefiles/).
