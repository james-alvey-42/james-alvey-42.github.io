# About Me

I am a PhD student in Theoretical Particle Physics and Comsology at King's College London. Broadly I am interested in how to model the early Universe and use data from Cosmology to constrain new physics. I'm also interested in how to use simple data techniques to answer people based research questions.

## Physics Profile

A summary of my recent publications can be found on [Inspire-HEP](http://inspirehep.net/search?p=exactauthor%3AJ.B.G.Alvey.1&sf=earliestdate).

### DarkBBN

The synthesis of light elements in the early universe is a complex process, and provides much insight into the thermodynamic state of each particle species that is present. The agreement between precise measurements of the light element abundances such as Hydrogen, Helium and Lithium provides strong evidence for a Hot Big Bang. Nonetheless, it is known that new physics is required both in the Standard models of particle physics and cosmology. The precision of these light element abundances can place tight constraints on the type of new physics that can be at play.

The relevant repository can be found [here](https://github.com/james-alvey-42/DarkBBN), and a summary of the work can be found at this [link](https://james-alvey-42.github.io/bbn/). The repository is related to two papers written with colleagues at King's College London:

* [Refined Bounds on MeV-scale Thermal Dark Sectors from BBN and the CMB](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.01649.pdf)
* [Improved BBN Constraints on the Variation of the Gravitational Constant](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10730.pdf)

### Boosted Dark Matter

There is a common issue with all direct detection experiments in that they lose sensitivity to light dark matter due to small nuclear recoils. We estimated the impact that inelastic collisions of cosmic rays in the atmosphere, producing light dark matter from meson decays, could have on the direct detection parameter space.

Again, the relevant repository for the work is found [here](https://github.com/james-alvey-42/BoostedDM), with a summary of the topic at this [link](https://james-alvey-42.github.io/boosteddm/). It is related to a paper written with colleagues at King's College London and the University of Cambridge.
